NAME: SUMIT SAH

TOPIC: How Machines Learn; Analogous to How Humans Learn
Organization: Topical
Specific Purpose: To help the audience understand how AI learns, by discussing three methods of learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforced.

**INTRODUCTION** 

 Attention Getter:
  Imagine opening Netflix and it recommends the exact movie you're in the mood for. Or Spotify which shows the list of your favorite music. But have you ever 
  wondered how does a machine know it ? That's because of something you have probably heard of - Artificial Intelligence.

 Relevance:
  AI is something that's already part of our everyday lives. Whether you're getting personalized  shopping recommendations on Amazon, or using Large Language Models 
  like ChatGPT, AI is helping us every day. Even spam filters in your email use AI to keep you away from the fraud emails.

 Credibility:
  I am a Computer Science major, and I keep up with recent advancements in technology, especially in the field of AI. I'm really enthusiastic about how these 
  machines learn at their core. While there are complex math algorithms involved, you don’t need to fear them at all—my passion is teaching these complex concepts 
  to a general audience without any math involved.

 Central Idea:
  The overall idea of this speech is to explain how Artificial Intelligence learns. 
 Initial Preview:
 supervised learning, unsupervised learning, 
  and reinforcement learning.

**BODY**
 
 Transition to 1st Main Point: First, let's talk about supervised learning.
 
 Point #1: 
  Think about how you learned to recognize animals as a child. Someone pointed and said, 'This is a dog,' and, 'This is a cat.' Over time, you learned to tell the 
  difference. Now even if you aren't shown the exact same "cat" or "dog" you can recognize any cat or dog-like species. Supervised learning 
  works the same way.
  
  - For instance, if we want an AI to recognize cats, we feed it lots of pictures labeled 'cat' until it understands the features of a cat.

  - Unlike us, AI doesn’t see images as shapes or colors right away; instead, it sees them as a collection of pixels with numerical values. The AI then analyzes 
    enough of these images to identify the patterns that define a 'cat.'

  - Remember the Netflix example from earlier? Netflix learns what you like based on your viewing history—this is supervised learning because it uses labeled data, 
    like your movie preferences, to make recommendations.

  - Another example is when you shop online. If you buy or like certain products, the store's AI will recommend similar items based on your preferences—again, 
     using labeled data to learn.

Transition to 2nd Main Point: Now that we’ve talked about supervised learning, let’s move on to unsupervised learning, which is quite different but just as 
                              interesting.

Point #2:
 In Unsupervised learning, we feed data without any labels i.e, AI has to figure out the patterns on its own. This means we feed tons of data, and it categorizes 
 those data and makes group based on similarities.

 - For example, if we give an AI a collection of animal pictures without telling it what each one is, it might group all the similar-looking animals together—cats 
   in one group, dogs in another.

 - Another example is anomaly detection, where AI identifies unusual data points that don’t fit the usual pattern. Banks use this to spot suspicious transactions, 
   helping detect potential fraud by identifying things that don’t match normal behavior.

Transition to 3rd Main Point: Now that we’ve explored supervised and unsupervised learning, let’s discuss the final type—reinforcement learning, which is all about 
                              learning through experience.
Point #3:

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where AI learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback, just like we do when we learn something new.

 - Imagine training a dog; you give it a treat when it follows a command and withhold it when it doesn’t. Reinforcement learning works similarly for AI, as it 
   learns which actions lead to positive outcomes.

 - One example is teaching an AI to play video games. It starts out not knowing the rules, but through trial and error, it figures out how to maximize its score.

 - Another example is self-driving cars. They use reinforcement learning to navigate roads safely, constantly adjusting their behavior based on their environment 
   and learning from successes and mistakes.
