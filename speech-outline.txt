“How Machines Learn”

Topic: How Machines Learn
Organization: Topical
Specific Purpose: To help the audience understand how AI learns, by discussing three methods of learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforced.


⦁	INTRODUCTION
  
  ⦁	Attention getter: Imagine opening Netflix, and it recommends the exact movie you're in the mood for. Or Spotify, which shows the list of 
     your favorite music. But have you ever wondered how a machine knows it? That's because of something you have probably heard of—artificial 
     Intelligence.
    
  ⦁	Relevance: AI is already part of our everyday lives, whether we're getting personalized shopping recommendations on Amazon or using large 
      language models like ChatGPT. Even spam filters in our emails use AI to keep us away from fraudulent emails.
    
  ⦁	Credibility statement:  I am a Computer Science major, and I keep up with recent advancements in technology, especially in the field of 
      AI. I'm enthusiastic about how these machines learn at their core and have done enough research on this topic. 
    
  ⦁	Central idea: Today, I want to explain how machines learn. While there are complex algorithms and math involved, you don’t need to fear 
      them at all—my goal is to explain this topic without any math involved, giving analogies to how humans learn.
   
  ⦁	Initial preview: The short answer would be machines process a lot of data, find patterns, make predictions, and gradually improve over 
      time. All of these have been grouped into three main categories based on how they interact with data: Supervised, Unsupervised, and 
      Reinforced Learning. First, we'll explore supervised learning, where AI learns from labeled examples. Then, we'll move on to 
      unsupervised learning, where AI tries to discover patterns on its own. Finally, we'll discuss reinforcement learning, which involves 
      learning through trial and error, just like we learn from our own experiences.

Transition to 1st main point: First, let’s talk about Supervised Learning

   ⦁	Point #1:  Think about how you learned to recognize animals as a child. Someone pointed and said, 'This is a dog,' and, 'This is a cat.' 
      Over time, you learned to tell the difference. Now even if you aren't shown the same "cat" or "dog" you can recognize any cat or dog- 
      like species. Supervised learning works the same way. It's when a machine learns from labeled examples.
      ⦁	If we want an AI to recognize cats, we feed it a lot of images labeled as "cat." Unlike us it doesn't see images rather it sees a 
        bunch of pixels, each with its own value. After analyzing enough images, it starts recognizing the patterns that make up a 'cat.'
      ⦁	According to a recent study by Smith et al. (2022), supervised learning is highly effective in training AI models for image 
        recognition, as labeled examples provide the necessary context for accurate predictions.
      ⦁	Remember the Netflix example? Netflix learns what you like based on what you’ve watched before. That’s supervised learning in action— 
        it’s using your viewing history, the posts you like, watch time, etc to make recommendations.
      ⦁	Applications that make heavy use of labeled data in supervised learning include image recognition, where AI learns to identify 
        objects, and speech recognition, where AI learns to understand and recognize voices. In natural language processing (NLP), labeled 
        data lets AI understand and generate human speech, powering technologies like chatbots, translation tools, and virtual assistants such 
        as Siri and Alexa.
