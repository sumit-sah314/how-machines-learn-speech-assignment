NAME: SUMIT SAH

TOPIC: How Machines Learn; Analogous to How Humans Learn
Organization: Topical
Specific Purpose: To help the audience understand how artificial intelligence learns, by discussing three methods of learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforced.

**INTRODUCTION** 

 Attention Getter:
  Imagine opening Netflix and it suggests the exact movie you're in the mood for. I know it must have happened to most of you. But have you ever wondered how a machine knows it ? 
  That's because of something you have probably heard of Artificial Intelligence.

 Relevance:
  AI is something that's already part of our everyday lives. Whether you're getting personalized shopping recommendations on Amazon, or using voice assistants like 
  Siri and Alexa, AI is helping us every day. Even spam filters in your email use AI to keep your inbox clean, and healthcare systems use it to help doctors make 
  better diagnoses. It's all around us, making things easier and more efficient.

 Credibility:
  I am a computer science major, and I keep up with recent advancements in technology, especially in the field of AI. I'm really enthusiastic about how these 
  machines learn at their core. While there are complex math algorithms involved, you don’t need to fear them at all—my passion is teaching these complex concepts to a general audience without any math involved.

 Central Idea:
  The overall idea of this speech is to explain how artificial intelligence learns by focusing on three main methods: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

 Initial Preview:
  Machines learn by analyzing large amounts of data to find patterns, make predictions, and improve over time. They use three main methods: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
  First, we'll explore supervised learning, where AI learns from labeled examples, similar to how a student learns from a teacher. Next, we'll look at unsupervised learning, where AI tries to find 
  patterns on its own without any specific guidance. Finally, we'll discuss reinforcement learning, where AI learns by trial and error, much like how we learn from experiences and feedback.

**BODY**
 
 Transition to 1st Main Point: 
  First, let's talk about supervised learning.
 
 Point #1: 
  Think about how you learned to differentiate between different animals as a child; someone told you, 'This is a dog' or 'This is a cat,' and over time you 
  learned the difference. Supervised learning works in the same way. Supervised learning is when AI learns from labeled examples. For instance, If an AI is 
  learning to recognize cats, it would be shown many pictures labeled 'cat' until it understands the features of a cat. Unlike humans, AI doesn’t see images the 
  way we do. It doesn’t recognize shapes and colors immediately; instead, it sees an image as a collection of pixels. Each pixel has numerical values that 
  represent its intensity and color. The AI learns to identify patterns based on these numbers, and by analyzing enough data, it starts to understand what makes an 
  image a 'cat'. Remember the Netflix example from earlier? Netflix learns what you like based on what you have watched before. This is a form of supervised 
  learning because it uses labeled data—your viewing history—to make recommendations. Another example is when you shop online. If you've bought or liked certain 
  products, the store's AI will recommend similar items based on your previous choices, which acts as labeled data for the algorithm.
