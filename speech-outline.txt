NAME: SUMIT SAH

TOPIC: How Machines Learn; Analogous to How Humans Learn
Organization: Topical
Specific Purpose: To help the audience understand how AI learns, by discussing three methods of learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforced.

**INTRODUCTION** 

 Attention Getter:
  Imagine opening Netflix and it recommends the exact movie you're in the mood for. Or Spotify which shows the list of your favorite music. But have you ever 
  wondered how does a machine know it ? That's because of something you have probably heard of - Artificial Intelligence.

 Relevance:
  AI is something that's already part of our everyday lives. Whether you're getting personalized shopping recommendations on Amazon, or using Large Language Models 
  like ChatGPT, AI is helping us every day. Even spam filters in your email use AI to keep you away from the fraud emails.

 Credibility:
  I am a Computer Science major, and I keep up with recent advancements in technology, especially in the field of AI. I'm really enthusiastic about how these 
  machines learn at their core. While there are complex math algorithms involved, you don’t need to fear them at all—my passion is teaching these complex concepts 
  to a general audience without any math involved.

 Central Idea:
  The overall idea of this speech is to explain how Artificial Intelligence learns by focusing on three main methods: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, 
  and reinforcement learning.

 Initial Preview:
  First, we'll explore supervised learning, where AI learns from labeled examples. Next, we'll look at unsupervised 
  learning, where AI tries to find patterns on its own without any specific guidance. Finally, we'll discuss reinforcement learning, where AI learns by trial and 
  error, much like how we learn from experiences and feedback.

**BODY**
 
 Transition to 1st Main Point: First, let's talk about supervised learning.
 
 Point #1: 
  Think about how you learned to recognize animals as a child. Someone pointed said, 'This is a dog,' and, 'This is a cat.' Over time, you learned to tell the 
  difference. Now you should not be shown the exact "cat" or "dog" we were shown, you can see any cat or cat-lie species and recogize them. Supervised learning 
  works the same way. It’s when AI learns from labeled examples.

  - For instance, if we want an AI to recognize cats, we show it lots of pictures labeled 'cat' until it understands the features of a cat.

  - Unlike us, AI doesn’t see images as shapes or colors right away; instead, it sees them as a collection of pixels with numerical values. The AI then analyzes 
    enough of these images to identify the patterns that define a 'cat.'

  - Remember the Netflix example from earlier? Netflix learns what you like based on your viewing history—this is supervised learning because it uses labeled data, 
    like your movie preferences, to make recommendations.

  - Another example is when you shop online. If you buy or like certain products, the store's AI will recommend similar items based on your preferences—again, 
     using labeled data to learn.
