#How Machines Learn: Analogous to How Humans Learn

This repository contains a speech assignment focused on explaining how artificial intelligence (AI) learns in a way similar to how humans learn. The presentation explores three main methods used by AI:

Supervised Learning: Similar to how a student learns with guidance, supervised learning involves AI learning from labeled examples.

Unsupervised Learning: Like a child trying to make sense of new information without instructions, AI uses unsupervised learning to discover patterns on its own.

Reinforcement Learning: Much like humans learn through experiences, AI uses reinforcement learning by learning from trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on actions.

The content aims to make complex AI concepts accessible to a general audience through analogies and relatable examples. It also references credible sources like academic journals, research reports, and popular tech platforms to support the explanations.
